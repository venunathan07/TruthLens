## 1. Overview

TruthLens is a **passive AI-powered Chrome extension** that detects and blurs misinformation on social media platforms in real time — without requiring any user action. It silently observes posts as they load, analyzes them using Groq's LLM, verifies claims with DuckDuckGo search grounding, and overlays flagged content with a blur, a confidence-scored label, and a full explanation popup.

Built for the everyday social media user who wants protection from misinformation without changing their browsing habits.

> **No clicks. No interruptions. Just silent, intelligent protection.**

---

## 2. Highlights

| Highlight | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| 🔍 Passive Detection | Scans posts silently using MutationObserver — zero user effort required |
| 🤖 Groq AI | llama-3.1-8b-instant — fast, accurate, sub-second inference |
| 🌐 Search Grounding | DuckDuckGo verifies flagged claims before blurring — reduces false positives |
| 📊 Weekly Dashboard | Popup shows posts scanned, flagged count, flag rate, and category breakdown |
| 💬 Explanation UI | "Why flagged?" popup with category, confidence score, and one-line AI reasoning |
| 👍 Feedback Loop | Users mark flags as correct or wrong — feedback sent to backend for improvement |
| 🐳 Dockerized | Backend containerized and ready for cloud deployment on Render / Railway |
| 🛡️ 90% Threshold | Only flags when AI is 90%+ confident — strict threshold minimizes false positives |
| 🌍 6 Platforms | Instagram, Twitter/X, WhatsApp Web, Facebook, LinkedIn, Naukri |
| 🔒 Privacy First | All data stays local — no cloud storage, no user accounts, no tracking |

---

## 3. Problem Statement

Social media has become the primary source of news and information for billions of people. However, it is also the fastest-spreading vector for misinformation, fake job postings, health myths, and scam courses — particularly targeting students and freshers in India.

| Problem | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Misinformation spreads 6x faster than truth on social media | MIT Study, 2018 |
| 59% of links shared on social media are never read before sharing | Columbia University |
| Fake job postings targeting freshers cause financial and career damage | NASSCOM Report |
| Health misinformation during crises leads to real-world physical harm | WHO Advisory |
| Scam courses with "100% placement guaranteed" claims defraud lakhs of students | Consumer Forum Reports |
| No passive, real-time misinformation filter exists for regular end users | Gap in the market |

Existing fact-checking tools (Snopes, AltNews, etc.) require users to manually submit content for verification — a friction point that most users skip entirely. No tool works silently in the background, the way an ad blocker does for advertisements.

**TruthLens fills this gap.**

---

## 4. Proposed Solution

TruthLens works like an ad blocker for misinformation — installed once, runs silently, protects automatically.

```
User opens Instagram / Twitter / Facebook / WhatsApp / LinkedIn / Naukri
        ↓
MutationObserver detects new posts loading into the DOM
        ↓
Post text extracted and batched (max 2 posts per call, 3s debounce)
        ↓
Chrome Service Worker relays batch to FastAPI backend (localhost:8001)
        ↓
Groq AI (llama-3.1-8b-instant) analyzes each post against 6 categories
        ↓
If flagged at 90%+ confidence → DuckDuckGo search grounding verifies the claim
        ↓
If still flagged → blur overlay applied with label, confidence score, and buttons
        ↓
User options: Show Anyway | See Explanation | Give Feedback (Correct / Wrong)
        ↓
Stats tracked in chrome.storage.local → visible in popup dashboard
```

---

## 5. Features

### Core Detection Engine
- Real-time post scanning on 6 social media platforms
- AI-powered classification into 6 distinct misinformation categories
- DuckDuckGo search grounding to remove false positives before blurring
- Strict 90% confidence threshold — only flags when truly certain
- Debounced batch queue — groups posts to minimize API calls and respect rate limits

### Blur Overlay UI
- Blurs flagged post image/content with a dark overlay
- Red label showing detected category and confidence percentage
- **"Show Anyway"** — instantly unblurs and dismisses the overlay
- **"Why flagged?"** — opens a detailed explanation popup

### Explanation Popup
- Category badge (fake_news, scam_course, fake_job, etc.)
- Confidence score displayed prominently
- One-sentence AI-generated explanation for why the post was flagged
- **"Correctly flagged"** and **"Wrong flag"** feedback buttons
- Feedback submitted to backend via POST /feedback endpoint

### Weekly Stats Dashboard (Extension Popup)
- Total posts scanned this week
- Total posts flagged this week
- Flag rate percentage
- Category breakdown with animated progress bars (fake_news, scam_course, etc.)
- Reset weekly stats button

### Multi-Platform DOM Scanning
| Platform | Selector Strategy |
|----------|-------------------|
| Instagram | `article` (structural, stable) |
| Twitter / X | `article[data-testid="tweet"]` |
| WhatsApp Web | `[data-testid="msg-container"]` |
| Facebook | `div[data-pagelet]` |
| LinkedIn | `.feed-shared-update-v2` |
| Naukri | `.jobTuple` job cards |

```

**Option B — Docker (Recommended):**
```bash
# Build image
docker build -t truthlens-api .

# Run container
docker run -d -p 8001:8001 --env-file backend/.env --name truthlens_backend truthlens-api

# Start / Stop
docker start truthlens_backend
docker stop truthlens_backend

# View logs

4. Select the `extension/` folder from this repository
5. Click the puzzle piece icon in the Chrome toolbar → pin **TruthLens**

---

### Step 6 — Start Using TruthLens

1. Make sure the backend is running (Step 4)
2. Open Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp Web, Facebook, LinkedIn, or Naukri
3. Scroll through your feed normally
4. Flagged posts will **blur automatically** with a red label
5. Click **"Why flagged?"** for a full explanation
6. Click the **TruthLens icon** in the toolbar to see your weekly dashboard

---

## 13. Scalability

| Concern | Current Implementation | Path to Scale |
|---------|------------------------|---------------|
| Batch Size | Max 2 posts per API call | Increase `MAX_BATCH` in `queue.js` |
| Debounce Delay | 3000ms | Reduce to 1000ms for faster detection |
| Concurrent AI Calls | `ThreadPoolExecutor` (sync Groq client) | Migrate to async Groq client |
| Backend Hosting | Local Docker on port 8001 | Deploy on Render / Railway / Fly.io |
| Groq Rate Limit | ~30 RPM on free tier | Upgrade plan or implement Redis request queue |
| Multi-User Support | Single-user Chrome extension | Add JWT auth + per-user Redis queue for SaaS |
| Stats Storage | `chrome.storage.local` (device-only) | Sync to backend DB for cross-device dashboard |
| Search Grounding | DuckDuckGo (free, no API key) | Upgrade to Google Custom Search API |
| Platform Coverage | 6 platforms | Add YouTube, Telegram, Reddit content scripts |
| Model Size | llama-3.1-8b-instant (fast, lighter) | Upgrade to llama-3.1-70b for higher accuracy |

---

## 14. Known Issues

| Issue | Status | Resolution |
